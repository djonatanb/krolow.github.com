It has been a long time that I’m write in some blogs, it has started in 2006, in this year, I was starting in this world of programming, I was im my first job, in a small company here in my city, that I have joined in 2005, so from 2005 to 2012, a lot of things changed not just in my life but also over the web, and I think it’s time to renew, several of my thoughts of 1 or 2 years ago are not more the same, and I really enjoy this, for me it looks that I’m constantly growing in my professional carrear.

So because this I’m starting from zero again, it will be my new blog, and I won’t be importing the old data of my blog, it will be like a new repository, where just new content will appears.

The focus of blog will be more than never in programming, it will be not focus anymore in languages, for sure the programming languages will appears here, and more often the languages that I use in my daily work, but the idea will be focus more in techniques and new stuffs that I’m learning each day.

I hope you enjoy the new blog, and if you are trying access a old post, I’m sorry for that, if you want you can ask me anything and for sure I’ll be here to answer.
