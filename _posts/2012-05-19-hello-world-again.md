It has been a long time that I’m write in some blogs, it has started in 2006, in this year, I was starting in this world of programming, I was im my first job in a small company here in my city, that I have joined in 2005, so from 2005 to 2012, a lot of things changed not just in my life but also over the web, and I think it’s time to renew, several of my thoughts of 1 or 2 years ago are not more the same nowadays, and I really enjoy this, for me it looks that I’m constantly growing in my professional carrer.

So because this I’m starting from zero again, it will be my new blog, and I won’t be importing the old posts, it will be like a new repository, where just new content should appears.

The focus of blog will be more than never in programming, it will be not focus anymore in languages, for sure the programming languages will appears here, and more often the languages that I use in my daily work, but the idea will be focus more in techniques and new stuffs that I’m learning.

I hope you enjoy the new blog, and if you are trying access a old post, I’m sorry for that, if you want, you can ask me anything and for sure I’ll be here to answer.
